Project Overview
For Assignment 03, I created a HTML index file and an images folder.
In the index file I practiced declaring document type and using different elements. I saved a screenshot of my completed index file to the images folder I created earlier.

A browser is a medium that provides a visual representation of the web content one requests from a server. I know I should use Firefox because it is open source and nonprofit but I've used Chrome for so long it is a habit.

Markup language is what "dictates the architecture of the page", meaning that it is what creates/comprises the web page/web application that one intends to view/use. XML is a markup language used to create a web page with elements that can behave independently of the status of the main page they comprise.
